Integration of the Fractal Identity Matrix (FIM) into the Multi-Agent Customer Support System
Overview
The goal is to enhance our customer support system by integrating the Fractal Identity Matrix (FIM) to:
Enable LLM reasoning and vector embedding functions to access and utilize meta vectors and node metadata.
Reduce the search space, making tradeoffs visible to both human users and the MCTS LATS algorithm.
Facilitate recursive state tracking and context propagation in the multi-agent system.
Improve tool delegation logic based on positional equivalence and recursive structures in the FIM.

1. Clarity in Meta Vector Representation
What Each Meta Vector Represents
Meta Vectors: Represent entities such as user queries, agent outputs, or knowledge snippets, with associated metadata like category, position in the FIM, relationships, and weights.
Node Metadata: Includes information about agents, tools, tasks, and their interrelations captured within the FIM.
Example MetaVector Class:
# Represents an entity in the system with associated information
class MetaVector:
    def __init__(self, category: str, position: Tuple[int, int], attributes: Dict[str, Any], weight: float):
        self.category = category      # e.g., 'UserQuery', 'FlightOption'
        self.position = position      # Position in the FIM matrix
        self.attributes = attributes  # Key-value pairs representing metadata
        self.weight = weight          # Significance or relevance score
Comment: The MetaVector captures both the content and context of an entity within the system, allowing LLMs and vector embedding functions to reason about its significance and relationships based on its position in the FIM.
---
2. Recursive Meta Vector Generation
How Meta Vectors Are Generated and Used
Meta Vector Generation: Agents generate meta vectors when processing inputs, capturing both the content and positional context within the FIM.
Recursive Traversal: Agents can recursively traverse related meta vectors in the FIM to gather context and make decisions.
Example Function:
def generate_meta_vector(agent_output: str, category: str, parent_position: Tuple[int, int], fim: FractalIdentityMatrix) -> MetaVector:
    # Generate embedding for agent output
    embedding = embed_text(agent_output)
    
    # Determine new position based on parent position and relationships
    new_position = fim.get_new_position(parent_position, category)
    
    # Create meta vector with attributes
    meta_vector = MetaVector(
        category=category,
        position=new_position,
        attributes={'content': agent_output, 'embedding': embedding},
        weight=calculate_weight(embedding)
    )
    
    # Add meta vector to FIM
    fim.add_meta_vector(meta_vector)
    
    return meta_vector
Comment: This function allows agents to generate new meta vectors recursively, with positions determined by the FIM structure, facilitating context propagation and recursive reasoning.
---
3. Meta Vectors in LLM Decision-Making
How LLMs Utilize Meta Vectors and Node Metadata
Reducing Search Space: By accessing meta vectors with specific positions, the LLM can focus on relevant context, reducing unnecessary computation.
Making Tradeoffs Visible: The LLM can compare meta vectors (e.g., different flight options) using their attributes and weights to present options and explain tradeoffs to users.
Example in LLM Prompting:
def create_llm_prompt(user_query: str, fim: FractalIdentityMatrix, current_position: Tuple[int, int]) -> str:
    # Retrieve relevant meta vectors based on position
    related_meta_vectors = fim.get_related_meta_vectors(current_position)
    
    # Prepare context for LLM
    context_snippets = []
    for mv in related_meta_vectors:
        # Use meta vector attributes for context
        context_snippets.append(f"Option (Weight: {mv.weight}): {mv.attributes['content']}")
    
    # Construct prompt
    prompt = f"User Query: {user_query}\n\n"
    prompt += "Relevant Information:\n" + "\n".join(context_snippets)
    prompt += "\n\nPlease provide the best options considering the above information."
    
    return prompt
Comment: By incorporating meta vector attributes and weights into the LLM prompt, the LLM can reason about the most relevant information and present tradeoffs clearly to the user.
---
4. State Information in Recursive Relationships
Propagation and Updating State Information
State Tracking: Agents update the state with their position in the FIM, which reflects their context and interactions.
Recursive Updates: As agents delegate tasks, they pass their position and relevant meta vectors, allowing state information to propagate recursively.
Example State Update:
def update_state(current_state: State, agent: Agent, fim_position: Tuple[int, int], meta_vector: MetaVector):
    current_state['agent'] = agent.name
    current_state['fim_position'] = fim_position
    current_state['meta_vectors'].append(meta_vector)
    return current_state
Comment: State information includes the current position in the FIM and accumulated meta vectors, enabling recursive context propagation across agents.
---
5. Positional Equivalence and Delegation
How Positions in the FIM Guide Delegation
Positional Equivalence: Agents and tools with similar positions in the FIM are closely related, guiding which agent or tool should handle a request.
Delegation Logic: Agents use the FIM to determine the next best agent or tool based on the user's needs and the positions of related entities.
Example Delegation Function:
def delegate_task(current_agent: Agent, fim: FractalIdentityMatrix, current_position: Tuple[int, int], user_input: str):
    # Find related positions with high weights
    related_positions = fim.get_high_weight_positions(current_position)
    
    # Select the next agent based on position
    next_agent = None
    max_weight = -1
    for pos in related_positions:
        weight = fim.get_weight_between_positions(current_position, pos)
        if weight > max_weight:
            max_weight = weight
            next_agent = fim.get_agent_at_position(pos)
    
    # Delegate task to the next agent
    if next_agent:
        next_agent.process_request(user_input, fim, pos)
    else:
        current_agent.handle_request(user_input)
Comment: This function demonstrates how an agent uses the FIM's positional relationships and weights to delegate tasks effectively.
---
6. State and Context Propagation in Multi-Agent Systems
Enhancing Adaptability and Context Maintenance
Context Passing: Agents pass along the current FIM position and relevant meta vectors when delegating tasks, maintaining context.
State Synchronization: Agents update their understanding based on the FIM, ensuring consistent state across the system.
Example in Agent Processing:
class Agent:
    def process_request(self, user_input: str, fim: FractalIdentityMatrix, position: Tuple[int, int]):
        # Update internal state
        self.state = update_state(self.state, self, position, None)
        
        # Generate meta vector for the user input
        meta_vector = generate_meta_vector(user_input, self.category, position, fim)
        
        # Decide whether to handle or delegate
        if self.can_handle_request(user_input):
            # Handle the request
            self.handle_request(user_input)
            # Update state with meta vector
            self.state = update_state(self.state, self, position, meta_vector)
        else:
            # Delegate to another agent
            delegate_task(self, fim, position, user_input)
Comment: Agents maintain and propagate context through state updates and meta vectors, ensuring that recursive relationships are respected and context is preserved.
---
7. FIM-Enabled Tool Delegation Logic
Dynamic Tool Routing Based on FIM Structure
Tool Selection: Based on the agent's position in the FIM and the weights of relationships, the most appropriate tool is selected.
Relevance Scoring: Tools associated with positions that have stronger relationships to the current position are prioritized.
Example Tool Selection Function:
def select_tool(agent: Agent, fim: FractalIdentityMatrix, position: Tuple[int, int], user_input: str) -> Tool:
    # Get related tool positions
    tool_positions = fim.get_tool_positions()
    
    # Score tools based on weight and relevance to user input
    best_tool = None
    max_score = -1
    for tool_pos in tool_positions:
        weight = fim.get_weight_between_positions(position, tool_pos)
        tool = fim.get_tool_at_position(tool_pos)
        relevance = calculate_relevance(tool, user_input)
        score = weight * relevance
        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_tool = tool
    
    return best_tool
Comment: This function shows how the FIM guides tool selection by combining positional weights and content relevance to ensure the most suitable tool is used.
---
8. LLM Coordination with FIM
Leveraging FIM for Improved LLM Reasoning
Interpreting FIM Structures: The LLM can reason about the relationships and positions in the FIM to make informed decisions.
Tradeoff Evaluation: By accessing meta vectors and their weights, the LLM can present and explain tradeoffs to the user.
Example LLM Reasoning Function:
def llm_decision_making(user_query: str, fim: FractalIdentityMatrix, current_position: Tuple[int, int]) -> str:
    # Get meta vectors relevant to the query
    relevant_meta_vectors = fim.get_relevant_meta_vectors(current_position, user_query)
    
    # Prepare input for LLM
    options = []
    for mv in relevant_meta_vectors:
        option = {
            'content': mv.attributes['content'],
            'weight': mv.weight
        }
        options.append(option)
    
    # LLM input includes options with content and weights
    llm_input = {
        'user_query': user_query,
        'options': options
    }
    
    # Generate LLM response
    response = llm_generate_response(llm_input)
    
    return response
Comment: The LLM uses the structured information from the FIM to evaluate options, considering their significance (weights), and generate responses that reflect tradeoffs and informed decisions.
